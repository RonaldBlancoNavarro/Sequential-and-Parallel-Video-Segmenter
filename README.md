# Sequential-and-Parallel-Video-Segmenter
This project consist in the code of a Sequential and Parallel Video Segmenter in C++, implementing three different versions:
Sequential using OpenCV.
Parallel using OpenCV and OpenMP.
Parallel using MPI-OpenMP and OpenCV.

The objective of this project was to compare performance and determine which implementation was the fastest in segmenting scenes from a video.
I used the OpenCV library for video processing and MPI-OpenMP for parallel programming.
